# SetCover
A few heuristic for the set cover problem.

The project contains 3 main python files
- setcover.py
- setcover_t.py
- comparealgorithms.py

# setcover.py
This contains the main functions of the project.

All algorithm take in input:
- h_elements: a dictionary of all elements to cover. The keys correspond to the elements, the value is set to 0 by default.
- l_sets: a list of tuples (weight of the set, dictionnary of elements in the set). As before, the keys correspond to the elements, the value is set to 0 by default.
- verbose: boolean. If set to true, the algorithm will print a lot of information useful mainly for debugging, or getting insights into the algorithm.

# comparealgorithms.py
Main file or comparing the results of the different algorithms.

# setcover_t.py
test file. Incomplete.
